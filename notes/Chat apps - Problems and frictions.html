THey can at any time join the conversation as long as it's going on. Like people talking in a room. There shouldn't be a need to go only within the particular time when the ring is ringing. I'm simply entering the room. There is no time constraint on it.</p><p>Also, there should be nothing like an admin of a call. If a person leaves the room, the conversation doesn't die out. People still talk. One by one, people live and the conversation naturally dies down.</p><p>What telegram has done in their reent update is amazing<a href=https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats>link to announcement</a>. The group is a constantly ongoing conversation. They simply interwove text and voice, and the result seems amazing. It's something so simple, yet so beautiful. People can simply text or talk in it. Text stays frozen in time, while voice is ephemeral. That's perfect.</p><p>COming back to voice and video calls. Chat apps mostly have voice and video as second class citizens. There is no simplicity and seamlessness in that.</p><p>The user should be able to seamlessly slip in and out of chats. Like discord</p><div class=codehilite><pre><span></span>|------------------------|

That was a dammn seamless experience. Why can't that too be the norm? What's stopping it's adoption? Lack of simple tools? or something else?</li><li>Video still has problems with it's choppyness. But even bad video is forgiven is the audio is crisp and clear. Have been seeing this problem on almost every remotely held podcast. There is already audio delay. But now on top of that, there is also this crappy audio quality.<ul><li>Regarding delay: Conversations on landlines were so much better: there was barely any noticeable delay, and hence barely any talking over one another. Now there is so much delay on ip calls that the two poeple talk to each other as if they are talking on walkie talkies.</li><li>If there's any problem that will greatly improve the quality of communication, it has to be this delay problem. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Discord too has it's problems. It came to replace older software like teamspeak. But it has theremdous overheads: * Every thing needs a seperate server * The admin has to set up dedicated channels for dedicated things * I still see too many people simply hanging out in general * There are too many individual permissions to control and tune in order to get a community going * The channels of inetractions should be emergent, not forced * Take an example of the solution mentioned above. Calls come and go. They are ephemeral, and natural. * What if people in dota flow away to a conversation about cs:go? Do they now switch channels? No. It's the group which controls the conversation, not the channel's label. The conversation flows with the group. * Classifying conversations is hard. So why should it be forced?</p><h1 id=what-did-zoom-get-right>What did zoom get right?</h1><h1 id=whats-the-need-of-a-server>What's the need of a server</h1><ul><li>Server is like a loud-speaker or a voice amplifier</li><li>p2p is fine for one on one communication, but servers solve some important problems:<ul><li>They hold the message till the reciever gets it, even when the sender goes offline while the reciever hasn't yet come online.<ul><li>This makes sure that the chat stays asynchronous and does not act like a phone call where everyone has to be present for communication to take place.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>In group chats, servers become crucial</p><ul><li>Sender can have bandwidth limits. The server acts like a loudspeaker so that all the recievers can hear the sender. A single sender's voice has a limit of loudness.</li></ul><p>Problems I have with servers:</p><ul><li>If a server is a simple holder and amplifier, why can't I host my own server.</li><li>I should simpmly be able to rent a server for like 5 dollars, and tell the server to watch this group</li><li>Once the server is approved, it simply acts as a dumb utencil</li><li>Beyond that, the server should be a dumb thing.</li></ul><p>Sole cases to think about:</p><ul><li>If a server watches over a group, what if some person outside the group gets invitation to join a chat room?<ul><li>Are the servers for ephemeral chat rooms different? Do they follow the person who rented them? What happens?</li><li>FOllowing the renter feels stupid. It makes him a defacto admin.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Concepts I have a problem with:</p><ul><li>The very concept of an admin in a group is stupid. People join a group to associate with the other poeple. Who is an admin to allow or disallow a person to come in or go out? This isn't natural</li><li>Defined groups by themselves are a gooey concept. What determines if a person joins a group or not? A majority vote? <ul><li>What about the case where in agroup of poeple, people are secretly friends with the unaprooved outsider. Do they form another group chat? How does this work in real life?</li></ul></li></ul><p>I have more questions than answers.</p></div><div class="section margined"><b>- eof -</b></div></div></body></html>
