Doesn't make sense to me at all. Looks like some tiny hacky shit humans made because they currently don't have enough resources to implement ai. Weird as fuck from my current perspective. <code></code> Random thoughts: Digital implementations don't have the synapse length limitation <code></code> This is a major mental rant This may not make any sense from the outside But from the inside it makes infinite sense to me ```</p><p><code>Initially in 2018 when I has an everything had clicked I wrote down this stuff At that time,I has called it knowledge consolidation. Turns out that there is a better word for it: "compression"</code> The brain is a limited resource The space is limited. The cranium might have grown over the course of time. (check?) But evolution is a slow process. Unlimited resources leads to stagnation. This is death to the growth part of the system. Intelligence arises out of the ability to manage this limited resource. For simplicity: assume that the brain is a 3d space. Tiny things called neurons live inside it and connect to each other. A neuron is a tiny store of understanding. Like a tiny byte on a ssd.</p><p>Initially when the kid is born, there is some bootloader-ish code. The system boots and the organs begin inputting all sorts of shit into the brain. Initially there is ample space. The new neurons absorb the information rapidly: useless-useful everything. Over time the brain fills up. When it fills up completely- then the fun part starts. Now there is no space left for more information. What to do now? There are 3 paths that can be taken: 1. Delete old stuff 2. Compress old stuff to make space for new stuff 3. A combination of both in some proportion</p><p>Doing deletion vastly increases probability of screwing up the entire thing. What if something useful is lost? What if everything useful is lost?</p><p>Doing compression vastly makes things difficult. Decompressing is an insanely expensive thing to do: digitally(electronically) and biologically What about the useless shit? What's the point of compressing that too? What about the useful shit? Why keep it with the useless shit and cause confusion?</p><p>So deletion is required along with compression. The answer? Learn and then compress and delete. This is where connections come in. How to build connections? Experience a 'thing' through the senses and save it. Experience multiple things through senses and save it. Then take time off and find the common brain regions across things. Now we have a region which is common across multiple things. Save this region once, forget the redundant copies, and form connections of the new common region with the remaining region of other 'things'. This is as simple as that, and all that there is to it. Simply take out common regions, make connections, delete orphaned regions and enjoy the new space.</p><p>This common region can be called as the 'common pattern'</p><p>So what about the granularity of a region? This is where another fun part comes on. Each basic storage unit: the neuron has limited storage space. These neurons connect to each other to combine knowledge. Let's call the connections neurons make with each other as synapse. The synapse uses up some resources(space, food, electricity, idk) and thus has finite length. Thus this thing has to be optimised.</p><p>Over time, several neurons which store similar information come together to connect and form a region full of similar information. This region is tight. For example: One region will process and store all visual shit. Other region will store all smells and shit and so on.</p><p>So hearing a car will store information in various regions. The visual region, auditory region, and the smell region. So now, what determines the location of a region? Intuition says that it depends on where the nerve connects the brain. For example, wherever the optic nerve connects to the brain, the optic region develops around it. Why? Because if the region is far away from the point where the nerve connects, many neurons will have to act as 'communicators' to the region. This is a waste of neurons. Why waste resources transport if you yourself can move to where the things come in. Long commutes are anyways a waste of life.</p><p>For simplicity, I'm focusing on optic and auditory centres. You see a thing and you hear it's sounds. The auditory and visual centers get filled up with fresh info. The regions then compress data locally(intra-region). The auditory region says: the sports car sounds like lawn-mover but fainter, scooter but a louder etc The visual region says: the sports car looks like the truck, but different, the scooter but different etc</p><p>This is local optimization But for the real benefits, someone has to join these two regions. This someone cannot be a specialist. It cannot be either purely visual, or purely auditory. It's the jack of all trades but master of none. But better than the master of one.</p><p>In comes the generalized sections of the brain. This is the true champ. It listens to what the visual sports car region and the autitory sports car region says and saves it as: sports car. An abstract region created for the car.</p><p>Then when it has the time: it finds what it has common with the other abstract concepts it has and does the local compression.</p><p>This is how we know that the sports car has wheels like other cars, but shinier. Has sounds like other cars, but louder and with a higher tempo and so on. Over time as the compression process is done again and again, the regions of existing vehicles and the sports car merge. The sports car region soon has a comparatively very tiny section which stores the things unique to sports cars.</p><p>So now, here comes the doubt: Does the generalist region store everything? Answer is: it cannot. It'll be a major waste of space since it'll lead to copying over things form the visual and auditory regions. Instead, it's a simple collection of pointers. Sports car? For how it looks: go here in the auditory region. For how it sounds: go here in the visual region.</p><p>The generalist region is simply a hotel menu. It understands and classifies the dishes and keeps it in an accessible format. But the actual things are originally kept somewhere else in the kitchen. The menu is a map. The generalist region is a map.</p><p>But things have nearly infinite combinations. Thus the generalist region has to be huge compared to the raw regions, to understand and store the various combinations.</p><p>Now, there has to exist some feedback from the generalist and the specific regions. The generalist is better at seeing all the cars it has stored and tell the visual region that: hey this, this, this and this car look similar. You can compress them. The visual region can so some local optimization like this car is yellow on the front and purple at the back. But what about the structure of the cars? Some have giant spoilers. Some have tiny spoilers. Some do not. This info is stored with the generalist brain.</p><p>What even is a spoiler? How it looks is stored in the visual centre. How it is is stored in the 'abstract thinking' center.</p><p>If you think enough about this storage, over time you'll realize that it's very difficult to truly seperate the various centres from each other. The generalist center has to be everywhere. Maybe it's not even a specific center. The auditory and visual regions can create synapses among themselves by themselves to understand stuff without a middle man. What's stopping them? The answer has to be that there is some limitation to the synapse length or density(the number of synapses one neuron can have) Thus there have to be some intermediates who connect the two regions together. Like a bunch of neurons storing the understanding of a car are joining the auditory and visual region. Initially these neurons will be located here and there, randomly where they are needed. Over time, the neurons which are storing things common to the car will come together and form a dedicated region of a car. So it's like taking the notes of a subject scattered across the room and arranging them in a neat pile to form the entire subject.</p><p>What caused this unification of the abstract thing called the car? The brain saw too many cars. The intermediate neurons scattered everywhere helped form connection between the audio-visual centres and formed thousands of scattered cars. Then the compression algorithm came and thought: Why the hell are there 1000 cars scattered everywhere? Unify that shit. Thus began the expensive process of knowledge unification. The understanding slowly flowed from neuron to neuron to a specific centre where the concept of car got formed. This must have done gigantic changes to the generalist neurons and even the specialist neurons!</p><p>What can be a better way to do this?</p><p>Dedicated Memory! Create a small army of neurons which simply stores shit loosely. When the brain gets time, it studies the cars stored in the memory section, compresses them, deletes(forgets) the unnecessary parts and then commits the final understanding to the specialist neurons which live between the audio-visual centres.</p><p>The memory section neurons have comparatively loose connection to the audio-visual centres. Thus they cannot and don't save all the info at once.</p><p>For example: you cannot remember a car you saw once accurately. This is because the memory neurons didn't store all the info that the sensory organs reported. You have to see the car again and again to completely store it and understand it. For example on seeing a car: First time: store the colour, hood structure, and basic low detailed info about the rims, overall chassis etc Second time: specific info about how the rims exactly look, how the lights are shaped, how the spoiler is tilted Third time: reaming details Thus it took seeing the car 3 times to truly store this.</p><p>Why such lossy storage? Why not store the entire car the first time the brain sees it? Simple: The space is limited, thus the neurons are limited, thus the memory neurons are limited. The brain has to optimise the stuff remembered. It has to judiciously use the space so that it won't get full immediately. It instead has to slowly get filled so it can last the entire day, until the compression algo kicks in at night, processes the memory and frees up space in the memory for the next day.</p><p>All this optimisation is being done through the compression part of the brain. Compression seems to be the only thing that there is.</p><p>The size and location regions can and must vary form human to human depending on what that human learnt and in what order those things were learnt.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
