Do not procastinate while meditating.</td></tr><tr><td>When to Move On</td><td>Don’t wait until you’ve mastered Stage One to begin Stage Two practices. As soon as you’ve succeeded in counting ten breaths and can follow several breaths before your mind wanders, start doing the Stage Two practices. If you find your mind becoming agitated, wandering again almost immediately after you return to the meditation object, or wandering for very long periods of time before you realize it, go back to Stage One. Work through the Four-Step Transition and then count the breaths at the nose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=stage-2>Stage 2</h2><table><thead><tr><th>item</th><th>item</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Worldly/Sense Desire</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Aversion &amp; Ill Will</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Laziness &amp; Lethargy</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Agitation due to Remose and Worry</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Doubt</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>What Kind of Dullness You're Working With</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>What Kind of Agitation You're Working With</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Level of effort</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>Shorten the periods of mind-wandering and extend the periods of sustained attention to the meditation object.</td></tr><tr><td>Obstacles</td><td>Mind-wandering, monkey-mind, and impatience.</td></tr><tr><td>Intention</td><td>Appreciate the “aha” moment that recognizes mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath. Then, intend to engage with the breath as fully as possible without losing peripheral awareness.</td></tr><tr><td>Key Skills / Method</td><td>Reinforcing spontaneous introspective awareness and learning to sustain attention on the meditation object. Spontaneous introspective awareness is the “aha” moment when you suddenly realize there’s a disconnect between what you wanted to do (watch the breath) and what you’re actually doing (thinking about something else). Appreciating this moment causes it to happen faster and faster, so the periods of mind-wandering get shorter and shorter.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>You can sustain attention on the meditation object for minutes, while most periods of mind-wandering last only a few seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>When to Move On</td><td>You can begin doing Stage Three practices whenever you have periods of 10 to 15 minutes without mind-wandering, even though forgetting still occurs and you may not yet have mastered Stages One and Two. When mind-wandering does occur, respond as in Stage Two.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=stage-3>Stage 3</h2><table><thead><tr><th>item</th><th>item</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Worldly/Sense Desire</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Aversion &amp; Ill Will</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Laziness &amp; Lethargy</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Agitation due to Remose and Worry</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Doubt</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>What Kind of Dullness You're Working With</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>What Kind of Agitation You're Working With</td><td>Low, Forgetting</td></tr><tr><td>Level of effort</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>Overcome forgetting and falling asleep.</td></tr><tr><td>Obstacles</td><td>Distractions, forgetting, mind-wandering, and sleepiness.</td></tr><tr><td>Intention</td><td>Invoke introspective attention frequently, before you’ve forgotten the breath or fallen asleep, and make corrections as soon as you notice distractions or dullness. Also, intend to sustain peripheral awareness while engaging with the breath as fully as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>Key Skills / Method</td><td>Use the techniques of following the breath and connecting to extend the periods of uninterrupted attention, and become familiar with how forgetting happens. Cultivate introspective awareness through the practices of labeling and checking in. These techniques allow you to catch distractions before they lead to forgetting.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>Rarely forgetting the breath or falling asleep.</td></tr><tr><td>When to Move On</td><td>When mind-wandering rarely if ever happens and you have extended intervals between episodes of forgetting, begin doing Stage Four practices.

Learning to work with pain. Purifying the mind of past trauma and unwholesome conditioning.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>Gross distractions no longer push the breath into the background, and breath sensations don’t fade or become distorted due to strong dullness.</td></tr><tr><td>When to Move On</td><td>Begin Stage Five practices whenever you have extended periods without gross distraction and strong dullness.

Developing a much more refined and selective awareness of the mind itself, called metacognitive introspective awareness. You will also use a method called “experiencing the whole body with the breath” to further subdue potential distractions.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>Subtle distractions have almost entirely disappeared, and you have unwavering exclusive attention together with vivid mindfulness.</td></tr><tr><td>When to Move On</td><td>Even before you have mastered Stage Six, when you have an extended period without subtle distraction and can sustain a high level metacognitive awareness, begin to work with Stage Seven practices.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=stage-7>Stage 7</h2><table><thead><tr><th>item</th><th>item</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Worldly/Sense Desire</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>Aversion &amp; Ill Will</td><td>Very low</td></tr><tr><td>Laziness &amp; Lethargy</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>Agitation due to Remose and Worry</td><td>Very low</td></tr><tr><td>Doubt</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>What Kind of Dullness You're Working With</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>What Kind of Agitation You're Working With</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>Level of effort</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>Effortlessly sustained exclusive attention and powerful mindfulness.</td></tr><tr><td>Obstacles</td><td>Distractions and dullness will return if you stop exerting effort. You must keep sustaining effort until exclusive attention and mindfulness become automatic, then effort will no longer be necessary. Boredom, restlessness, and doubt tend to arise during this time. Also, bizarre sensations and involuntary body movements can distract you from your practice. Knowing when to drop all effort is the next obstacle. But making effort has become a habit, so it’s hard to stop.</td></tr><tr><td>Intention</td><td>Continuously guard against dullness and distraction</td></tr><tr><td>Key Skills / Method</td><td>Practicing patiently and diligently will bring you to the threshold of effortlessness. It will get you past all the boredom and doubt, as well as the bizarre sensations and movements. Purposely relaxing your effort from time to time will let you know when effort and vigilance are no longer necessary. Then you can work on letting go of the need to be in control. Various Insight and jhāna practices add variety at this Stage.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>You can drop all effort, and the mind still maintains an unprecedented degree of stability and clarity.</td></tr><tr><td>When to Move On</td><td>"Whenever you have extended periods of effortlessness, even if they can’t be sustained for the entire sit, start experimenting with Stage Eight practices. If dullness or distraction begin to arise, resume the exercise of vigilance and effort until you effortlessness returns.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When you reach the end of Stage Seven, there’s enough unification to produce the effortlessness of mental pliancy, which always comes with some meditative joy. Joy seems to be the “natural” state of a unified mind, and the more unified a mind is, the more joyful it is. Joy is also the “glue” that helps keep a mind unified.</p><p>Experiencing joy while breathing in, he trains himself. Experiencing joy while breathing out, he trains himself.

Jhāna and other Insight practices are very productive as part of this process.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>When the eyes perceive only an inner light, the ears perceive only an inner sound, the body is suffused with a sense of pleasure and comfort, and your mental state is one of intense joy.

How important is this to you? Whether dull or agitated this can be a great antidote to obstacles in meditation.

If that doesn’t work then ramp it up to the next level. NEVER give in to agitation, or dullness that is inappropriate for the stage you are at.
