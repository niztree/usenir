<blockquote>
<p>The moment we believe that success is determined by an ingrained level of ability as opposed to resilience and hard work, we will be brittle in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>- Joshua Waitzkin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just watch this TedX talk first : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc">Eduardo Briceno: The Power of belief - mindset and success</a></p>
<p>Hard work, grit, persistence are not something that you do intentionally. They are all side effects of the growth mindset.</p>
<p>Growth mindset is the understanding that no matter what level you are at right now, through dleiberate practice and feedback, you can grow.</p>
<p>The opposite of this is the fixed mindset. It’s very very common. The fixed mindset assumes that ability depends on something fixed like intelligence or talent. If one does not have it, one cannot succeed.</p>
<p>These two mindsets have totally different ways of doing things:</p>
<p><strong>When putting in effort:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mindset person sees effort as a bad thing, treating it as something that poeple with low intelligence or ability do.</li>
<li>Growth mindset person sees effort as something that makes one smart. It's treated as a way to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After hitting a setback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mindset person will conclude that they are incapable. To protect their ego, they lose interest or withdraw.</li>
<li>Growth mindset person understands that setbacks are a part of growth. When they hit one, they work around it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When doing something:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mindset person focuses on the end result like marks, grades etc</li>
<li>Growth mindset person focuses on feedback about what went wrong, and how to improve it next time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So how do you develop a growth mindset?</strong></p>
<p>Through one simple thing: praise yourself for effort, not for ability. Focus on progress instead of intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saying "Wow, you must be smart at this" is fixed mindset praise.</li>
<li>Saying "Wow, you must have tried really hard" is growth mindset praise because it focuses on the progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, ablity is something that is elastic and can be built up, not something fixed.</p>
<p>Instil a growth mindset in yourself. You'll automatically start working harder, and you will enjoy it.</p>
<p><em>Listen for your fixed mindset voice, and when you hear it, talk back with a growth mindset voice. If you hear 'I can't do it', add 'yet'.</em></p>
<h1 id="flow">Flow</h1>
<p><strong>What does it even mean?</strong></p>
<p>To become so involved, so absorbed in an activity that nothing else matters. Not even time.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with motivation.</p>
<p><strong>How can I enter flow consistently?</strong></p>
<p>Flow comes from the following 4 things:</p>
<p><strong>1. Clarity of goal</strong></p>
<p>Have a very clear micro goals and macro goal.</p>
<p><strong>Macro goal</strong>: What are you trying to achieve in the next few weeks? In the next few months? What is the overall purpose of you doing this work?</p>
<p>Eg: To get 80% in exams to get into a particular college. Or to get into this MS program.
Have some sort of specific overarching goal.
Sitting and just reading intensely, loooking through notes, doing questions does not work.</p>
<p><strong>Micro goal</strong>: What exactly you want to achieve from this particular study session?</p>
<p>Without specific goals, doing the work becomes unsatisfying and you become distracted very easily.</p>
<p>Eg: If you're running a marathon, it's easier to run it if you know how much distance you have to cover. You are more likely to stop if you are simply running and don't know when the finish line will appear.</p>
<p><strong>2. Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The goal needs to be challenging, but not too challenging.</p>
<p>Flow happens when the task is challenging enough for the current skill level.
You enter into a positive feedback loop: as the challenge increases, skill increases; as the skill increases, challenge increases. This is flow.</p>
<p>If the challenge is low and your skill is high, you'll get bored because the task is too easy for your skill. If challenge is high and your skill is low, you will become anxious and eventually give up.</p>
<p>Plan your exercises. Tune how hard your micro and macro goals are.</p>
<p>Macro goal: If you are doing good, increase your target precentage/grade/rank. Keep so difficult that it's likely that you don't get it, but it's possible that you might be getting it.</p>
<p>Micro goals: Increase/decrease the target number of questions you will solve within the hour. Tune it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Absence of distractions</strong></p>
<p>It's difficult to get into flow, but it's easy to maintain it. If you continuously stop and start, it's not going to work.</p>
<p>Suppose you are cycling on a flat road. It takes a lot of energy to increase your speed from 0 to 10. But once you get to 10, it takes comparitively lower amount of additional energy to increase your speed to 15 and maintain it there.</p>
<p>Now imagine if someone crosses the road and you need to stop the bike. sNow you'll again need additional energy to get to 20. Don't let distractions come and make you continuously spend energy going from 0 to 15 again and again. It wastes a lot of energy, gets lesser work done and is very frustrating.</p>
<p>The phone is a giant distraction. Either keep it in a locked drawer, or keep it in a different room. Simply keeping it on your bed while you sit on a table is not enough. Keep it such that getting to the phone needs considerable effort, so you;ll notice when you subconsciously reach for your phone.</p>
<p><strong>4. Time</strong></p>
<p>You slowly build yourself up to consistently get into flow.</p>
<p>You have invested years of your time in being distracted. It will take time to unlearn distraction and learn to focus. It could take weeks. </p>
<p>Initially there is a lot of resistance. You are practically doing mental violence on yourself, forcing the brain to give up old habits and ignore distractions.
Day in and day out, after doing it again and again, the brain will get used to it and flow will automatically become available and enjoyable.</p>
<h1 id="deep-work">Deep work</h1>
<p>Deep work is and will be one of the most important skills a person can have. Depth of your work is more important than how long you work. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Work accomplished = time spent x intensity
</pre></div>


<p>It's not how long you sit. It's how deeply you work. Doing 4 hours of deep focus can be equivalent to doing 12 hours of shallow focus. A normal person has a deep focus budget of about 4 hours. People who are used to focusing have a budget of about 6-9 hours</p>
<p>Read the book <code>Deep Work by Cal Newport</code>. You can also find summaries online. It's a very important book.</p>
<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>
<p>A schedule will set you free. You won't have to think and make decisions about what to do. You'll simply know what you have to do. All you have to do is follow the schedule.</p>
<p><strong>What even is a schedule?</strong></p>
<p>It's simply a system that you use to complete planned goals. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need a schedule?</strong></p>
<p>Because it sets you free, and after some days you don't even have to think about what to do. Things start happening automatically.</p>
<p><strong>What does actually matter in a schedule?</strong></p>
<p>Your job is to make sure that your schedule completely uses up your brain's deep focus budget.</p>
<p>The remaining time is all shallow work. You'll notice when your deep work budget is up and the brain simply lets go. Deep focus is limited as it actually strains the brain.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make a schedule?</strong></p>
<p>It's your life, you decide. Make sure that you keep some gaps in between deep work sessions to recover from fatigue. Take a nap, do some shallow work, do some exercise. Well planned breaks are important to avoid burnout. </p>
<p>Pomodoro is an excellent method. I personally do 50-10 (50 mins focus, 10 mins break. It works well for me).</p>
<p><strong>If deep focus is limited, how does flow stay for such a long time?</strong></p>
<p>If you adjust the challenge properly, you are not immediately stressing your brain. You are slowly streching it's current limit. So if you do 100 units of something, probably 30 of it will be hard for you and remaining 70 will not be too hard(it'll match your current level).</p>
<p><strong>What if I burn out?</strong></p>
<p>Pushing yourself hard isn't easy. Be really careful about not getting into a burnout. If you get into a burnout, understand what happened and don't do it again. Burning out means that you don't understand your current limits well enough. Tune your schedule and wait till things get better again.</p>
<h1 id="maintaining-habits">Maintaining habits</h1>
<p>Use the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy">seinfeld method</a>. It's brainless and it works.</p>
<p>Use a small and simple pocket diary. No need to use fancy apps to track stuff. Tracking offline and on paper works better.</p>
<p>For habits, either read <code>Atomic Habits by Jasmes Clear</code> or watch some YouTube videos about it. This is the best book out there to easily make and break habits without too much effort.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-and-posture">Exercise and posture</h1>
<p>Always be active. Do some exercise: gym, running, bodyweight exercises etc. It's the best way to maintain mental health and make sure that you can study for longer consistently. Take fitness very seriously.</p>
<p>To truly push yourself for years, you have to be physically sound, or you'll enter one of those long lasting burnouts. Those are very very difficult to deal with. Don't be stupid.</p>
<p>If you are doing something that involves sitting for long periods of time, focus on your posture. Invest in it via good chair, table etc. It's worth it. </p>
<h1 id="sleep">Sleep</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleep is not a luxury, sleep is a biological necessity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately stop listening to people who tell you to get rid of sleep to increase learning time. They are idiots who don't understand how the brain works(so this includes most motivational speakers). Less/bad sleep is not sustainable over the long term and it'll stagnate your mental growth.</p>
<p><strong>How does sleep help me?</strong></p>
<p>Waking up on time is all about getting enough sleep. 8 hours is a nice time to aim for.</p>
<p>Waking up early is easy. The toughest part is sleeping on time.</p>
<p>However, an person's morning or evening chronotype is genetic and fixed. You can fight your natural system, but it'll lead to low quality sleep. Try not to strain it, or it'll immediately affect things like metabolism, mental performance etc.</p>
<p>Sleep is needed both before and after intense learning. Learning new things is practically mental violence, and it demands good sleep.</p>
<p><strong>How do I fall asleep on time?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep phone away at least an hour before planned sleep time. Basically, bore your brain into sleep.</li>
<li>Drop the room temperature when you go to bed. Makes it easier to fall asleep.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Have regularity<ul>
<li>Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter weekday or weekend.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Your habits</li>
<li>How to do more deep work</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Understand flow and create conditions to consistently enter it.</li>
<li>Have a schedule that you can consistently stick to. It sets you free.</li>
<li>Good adequate sleep is important. Plan well to get enough of it.</li>

<p>I have a personal hate for self-help books. Almost all of them are shallow and useless. Only very very few have been useful through the years. Two of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jordan Peterson: 12 rules for life</li>
<li>David Goggins: Cant Hurt Me. Prefer the audio book: it's very very good.</li>
</ul>
