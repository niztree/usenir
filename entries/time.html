What if we could add an entire new month to your year for doing useful stuff? Sounds too good right?</p><p>Well, it's highly possible and the math is simple to understand.</p><h2>Napkin calculations</h2><p>2 hours of every day means 712 hours per years, which means one month of every year. So using 2 hours of the day, everyday is like using 1 month of the year, every year.</p><p>So basic rough calculations are: * 1 hour of a day = half a month of a year * 2 hours of a day = 1 month of a year</p><p>Now some insights into your day:</p><p>If you are spending 2 hours every day commuting to and from your office, congratulations. You spent your entire January 24x7 sitting on the streets. </p><p>If you are spending another 2 hours scrolling through bullshit content on ig, reddit etc: congratulations. You spend your entire Febtruary too. 24x7 touching and scrolling that piece of glass on your phone.</p><p>Now my collegues easily spend 2 hours per day on instagram.

You are already wasting entire MONTHS.</p><p>Imagine sitting for one month doing nothing but scrolling and double tapping on phone. Non stop.</p><p>Or if you spend two hours per day doing nothing but</p><h2>Why does this happen?</h2><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Spending one month per day is easier than spending one month per year. Think about that. </p><p>Save your entire month. Spend it on something useful like sleeping, studying, learning an instrument or something.</p>
