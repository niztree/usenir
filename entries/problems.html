Why do people blindly put down citations from the parent papers they cited? * How to distribute knowledge globally in a way that the thing we share is atomic? * Package it into a single node? * Make a forest of nodes, with an index node aka 'context' that gives addresses of relevant nodes? * Can existing technology be used to solve this problem? * Is there a better way to represent knowledge? * Why do we end up with 1000tabs open in our browsers? How to fix browsers?</p><h2>How to thinks about these problems?</h2><ul><li>Think backwards</li><li></li></ul>
