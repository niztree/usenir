Write down what you know about the subject you’re about to read — a mind map if you will.</li><li>After you are done a reading session spend a few minutes adding to the map (we use a different color ink).</li><li>Before you start your next reading session, review the mindmap (we use ours as a bookmark sometimes.)</li><li>Put these mind maps into a binder that you periodically review.</li></ol>
