<h1>Getting things done</h1><p>[[Book summary, productivity]]</p><h2>1.The Principle: Dealing effectively with internal commitments</h2><ul><li>Most of the stress comes from inappropriately managed commitments people make or accept.</li><li>Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an open loop pulling on your attention.</li></ul><p><strong>Why things are on your mind</strong> 1. you haven't clarified what the outcome is 2. you haven't decided what the next physical action step is 3. you haven't put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system you trust You cannot fool your mind. It will keep working overtime until you write stuff down in a place it knows you will look without fail.</p><p>Transformation of Stuff * Stuff is something that you have allowrd into your world that doesn't belong where it is, but you haven't yet determined the desired outcome and the next action step. * As long as it's still stuff, it's not organized. * Most failed todo lists are merely listings of stuff, not inventories of real work that needs to be done.</p><p><strong>The process:Managing action</strong> * You don't manage priorities. You have them. * Lack of time is not the major issue. The real problem is lack of clarity and definition about what a project is and what next-action steps are required.</p><h2>2.

You do action steps related to it.</li><li>Project list is simply an index. All details, plans and supporting info should be kept in a separate notebook.</li><li><strong>Calendar</strong>:<ul><li>Time specific actions aka appointments</li><li>Day specific actions: Some time on certain day, but not really at a specific time</li><li>Day specific information: Calendar is also used to keep track of things you want to know about on specific days.</li><li><strong>No more daily ToDo lists</strong>. Only these 3 things go on the calendar. Nothing else. Keeping a list on calendar and not getting it done is demoralising.</li><li>Why ToDo lists don't work: Constant new input and changing priorities change daily work consistently. Rewriting tasks not done today to another day is a waste of time. Next actions does this better.</li><li>Something on the list that doesn't HAVE to be done on that day reduces the emphasis of things you truly want to do.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Next actions list</strong>: Action reminders go on this list. Subdivide into categories if this list is too long.</li><li><strong>Non actionable items</strong><ul><li>Trash: throw away what doesn't have future action or reference value.</li><li>Someday/Maybe: The parking lot of projects. A reminder of things you want to possibly do.</li><li>Reference material: Things with no action but intrinsic value as information. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Review the results<ul><li>The projects, calendar, next actions list and waiting list system doesn't need much maintenance.</li><li>Review frequency(descending): calendar, next actions.</li><li>Next actions come into play in relevant contexts (actions when at home, actions when at work etc)</li><li><strong>Weekly review</strong>: Review ALL open loops once a week. Use the review to gather and process all stuff. Review the system.
